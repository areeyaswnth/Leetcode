# Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [3,4,5]
# Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: [4,5,6]
# Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 100
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
