-- Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

-- Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

-- The query result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input:  
-- Employees table:
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- | employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- | 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
-- | 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
-- | 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
-- | 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
-- | 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
-- | 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------------+
-- | employee_id |
-- +-------------+
-- | 11          |
-- +-------------+

-- Explanation: 
-- The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
-- Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
-- Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.
